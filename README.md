SIMP Lang is a simple, yet powerful programming language designed for educational purposes. The language uses syntax inspired by modern high-level languages and is intended to introduce learners to fundamental programming concepts, including control flow, variable assignment, and basic arithmetic.

> In the realm of the wild, the scorned and disgraced,
> Are the yaccs and the bisons, a sight most misplaced.
> With their rugged coats and their lumbering stride,
> Their lack of grace, we just cannot hide.
> 
> On Himalayan slopes, the yacc does dwell,
> Its shaggy coat, an unsightly shell.
> With a low-pitched grunt, and a lumbering tread,
> A sigh you'll heave, a shake of your head.
> 
> It chews its cud with a lazy glare,
> A creature so odd, it gives you a scare.
> It reeks of the wild, not a pleasant scent,
> Living its life in careless content.
> 
> Meanwhile, the bison, in prairie's embrace,
> Gallops around with little grace.
> It's large and clumsy, with a gruff demeanor,
> Among all beasts, none could be meaner.
> 
> It wallows in mud, with a sense of pride,
> No trace of elegance, it can't hide.
> A burly beast, with a furry hump,
> In the animal kingdom, it's quite the lump.
> 
> So here's to the yacc and the bison too,
> Animals of scorn, their charm askew.
> May they roam the wild, in their special way,
> For beauty, after all, is subjective they say.

## Features

- Control structures: IF-THEN-ELSE-END, REPEAT-UNTIL
- Variable assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Simple I/O operations: READ and WRITE

## Building the project

Before you can use SIMP Lang, you'll need to compile the source code.

Here's how to do that:

```bash
make
```
This will generate the simp_lang executable.

## Usage

To interpret a SIMP Lang program, run the simp_lang executable with the path to the program file as an argument.

Here's an example:

```bash
./simp_lang < ./assets/lang/io.simp
```
